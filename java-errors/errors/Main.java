    ** Java Debugging

    What is Debugging?

    Debugging is the process of indetifying and fixing error or bugs in you code.

    It often involves:
    	
    	- Reading error messages
	
	- Tracing variable values step by step
	
	- Testing small pieces of code independently.

	** Debugging Checklist:

		- Read the full error message, it often tells you exactly what's wrong.

		- Check if all variables are initialized before use.

		- Print variable value to trace the problem.

		- Watch for off-by-one errors in loops and arrays.

		- Comment out sections of code to find bugs.
